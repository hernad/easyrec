Provides utilities for DAO implementation. Some of these utilities help with common problems
in JDBC code, like e.g. fetching an integer from a <code>ResultSet</code> with null checking,
which normally would be coded like this:
<pre>
 Integer value = rs.getInt(columnName);
 if (rs.wasNull()) {
  	value = null;
 }
</pre>
with {@link at.researchstudio.sat.util.dao.DAOUtils}, this becomes
<pre>
 Integer value =	DAOUtils.getInteger(rs, columnName);
</pre>
<p>
    Other parts of this package work together with the package
    <code>at.researchstudio.sat.testutil.dao</code> in project <code>sat-testutil</code>, the idea of
    which is that DAO classes can be tested in their normal environment by simply exchanging their
    configured <code>DataSource</code>. DAOs that are to be treated this way must be annotated with
    {@link at.researchstudio.sat.util.store.dao.DAO}.
</p>

<p>
    Yet another part of this package is dedicated to standardizing DAO behaviour via aspect-oriented
    programming (see package {@link at.researchstudio.sat.util.store.dao.aop}). This mechanism is used to
    catch certain exceptions that are thrown in DAO code, and which originate in JDBC code of the
    spring framework, and return <code>null</code> instead. The idea is that all DAOs return
    <code>null</code> if no object is found and only throw exceptions if something goes wrong.
